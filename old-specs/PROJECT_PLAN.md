# Project Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive project roadmap for the AI Research Automation Platform, integrating current implementation status with future development goals.

## Executive Summary

The project aims to deliver a unified visual workflow management system with integrated node-based query capabilities, combining research automation, data processing, and collaborative features.

## Current Implementation Status

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Status**: 70% complete
- **Implemented**: Core API structure, research agent, modular services
- **Gaps**: Query execution engine, full frontend integration

### Frontend (Next.js + React)
- **Status**: 60% complete
- **Implemented**: WorkflowBuilder, QueryNode, ReactFlow integration
- **Gaps**: Performance optimization, complete node types

### Chrome Extension
- **Status**: 50% complete
- **Implemented**: Content extraction, file export
- **Gaps**: Main application integration

### Context Portal
- **Status**: 40% complete
- **Implemented**: Database infrastructure
- **Gaps**: Active utilization in workflows

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Fixes (Weeks 1-4)

**Week 1-2: Critical Infrastructure**
- Resolve ReactFlow performance issues
- Implement missing automation scripts
- Stabilize QueryNode and QueryEditor components

**Week 3-4: Core Integration**
- Backend query execution engine
- Complete basic node types (DataSource, Filter, Transform)
- Query graph persistence

**Success Metrics:**
- ReactFlow handles 50+ nodes with <100ms response time
- YouTube transcription workflow functional
- Basic query execution working

### Phase 2: Query System Core (Weeks 5-8)

**Week 5-6: Advanced Node Types**
- Aggregate, Join, Union node implementations
- Custom node creation framework
- Node validation and error handling

**Week 7-8: Workflow Integration**
- QueryNode integration with WorkflowBuilder
- Real-time execution monitoring
- Query result visualization

**Success Metrics:**
- Support for 5+ node types
- Query graphs save/load with 100% fidelity
- WorkflowBuilder fully integrated

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)

**Week 9-10: Enhanced Functionality**
- Real-time collaboration
- Query versioning and history
- Performance optimization for large graphs

**Week 11-12: Production Readiness**
- Chrome extension integration
- Context portal utilization
- Production deployment preparation

**Success Metrics:**
- Multi-user collaboration functional
- System ready for production deployment

## Technical Architecture

### ReactFlow Integration
- Performance optimization with virtualization
- Proper state synchronization with Zustand
- Comprehensive error boundaries

### Query ↔ Workflow Integration
- QueryNode opens QueryEditor modal
- Seamless workflow execution
- Unified result handling

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Playwright, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Next.js, ReactFlow, Zustand
- **Integration**: REST APIs, Server-Sent Events

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
- ReactFlow performance issues → Dedicated optimization phase
- Query execution complexity → Incremental node type implementation
- Component integration → Clear API contracts and testing

### Dependencies
- ReactFlow stability for query building
- Backend API availability for execution
- Chrome extension for data capture

## Success Criteria

- Complete node-based query system integrated with workflow management
- All technical debt resolved
- System performs reliably under typical usage
- Maintainable and extensible architecture

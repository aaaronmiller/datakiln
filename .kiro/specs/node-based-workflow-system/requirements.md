  - Each provider has appropriate interface configuration
  - Response handling adapts to provider-specific formats
  - Can switch between API and web interface modes
  - Consistent data flow regardless of provider

### Epic 5: Workflow Orchestration

**As a workflow designer, I want to connect nodes into workflows**
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Nodes connect via visual interface (ReactFlow)
  - Data flows clearly from one node to the next
  - Workflow saves as JSON object with all configurations
  - Can import/export workflows for sharing
  - Workflow execution shows progress through each node

**As an automation user, I want remote workflow triggering**
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Workflows can be triggered via JSON input
  - Input format matches expected node requirements

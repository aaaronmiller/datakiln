### Tutorial 2: DOM Automation Workflow

**Goal**: Automate web scraping and data extraction from a website.

#### Visual Workflow Setup

```
[DOM Action: Navigate] â†’ [DOM Action: Extract] â†’ [Transform: Clean] â†’ [Export: JSON]
```

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Navigate to Target Website**
   ```
   Node Type: DOM Action
   Action: Navigate
   URL: https://example-news-site.com
   Wait Time: 2000ms
   ```

2. **Extract Article Headlines**
   ```
   Node Type: DOM Action
   Action: Extract Multiple
   Selector: article h2
   Output Key: headlines
   ```

3. **Clean and Format Data**
   ```
   Node Type: Transform
   Transform Type: Text Clean
   Input Key: headlines
   Remove: HTML tags, extra whitespace
   ```

4. **Export Results**
   ```
   Node Type: Export
   Format: JSON
   Filename: news-headlines.json
   Include Timestamp: true
   ```

#### Pro Tips
- Use browser developer tools to identify CSS selectors
- Test selectors individually before building complex workflows
- Add error handling with Condition nodes for robust automation

### Tutorial 3: Conditional Data Processing Pipeline

**Goal**: Process data with conditional logic and multiple output paths.

#### Advanced Workflow Pattern

```
[Data Source] â†’ [Condition: Check Status]
â”œâ”€â”€ True â†’ [Transform: Success Format] â†’ [Export: Success File]
â””â”€â”€ False â†’ [Transform: Error Format] â†’ [Export: Error File]
```

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Data Input Node**
   ```
   Node Type: Data Source
   Source Type: API/JSON
   Data: [{"status": "success", "data": "..."}, {"status": "error", "data": "..."}]
   ```

2. **Conditional Logic**
   ```
   Node Type: Condition
   Expression: item.status == "success"
   True Branch: Process successful items
   False Branch: Handle errors
   ```

3. **Success Path Processing**
   ```
   Transform Node: Format successful data
   Export Node: Save to success-results.json
   ```

4. **Error Path Processing**
   ```
   Transform Node: Format error reports
   Export Node: Save to error-logs.json
   ```

## ðŸ”„ Advanced Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Parallel Processing Pipeline

**Use Case**: Process multiple data sources simultaneously for faster execution.

```
[Data Source A] â†’ [Process A] â†’ [Merge Results]
[Data Source B] â†’ [Process B] â†’ [Merge Results]
[Data Source C] â†’ [Process C] â†’ [Merge Results]
                      â†“
                [Final Export]
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster execution through parallel processing
- Independent failure handling
- Scalable for multiple data sources

### Pattern 2: Iterative Refinement Loop

**Use Case**: Improve AI-generated content through iterative refinement.

```
[Initial Prompt] â†’ [AI Provider] â†’ [Quality Check]
    â†‘                                       â†“
    â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ [Refine Prompt] â—„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

**Implementation**:
- Use Condition nodes to check quality thresholds
- Loop back to refinement until criteria met
- Limit iterations to prevent infinite loops

### Pattern 3: Multi-Provider Comparison

**Use Case**: Compare outputs from different AI providers.

```
[Input Query] â†’ [Gemini Provider] â†’ [Results Collector]
[Input Query] â†’ [Perplexity Provider] â†’ [Results Collector]
[Input Query] â†’ [Custom Provider] â†’ [Results Collector]
                      â†“
              [Comparison Analysis] â†’ [Export Report]
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Backend setup
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Frontend setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview

# Extension setup
# Load unpacked extension from chrome-extension/ directory
```

### 2. Configuration
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] API keys properly set
- [ ] Database connections configured
- [ ] Logging levels set appropriately

### 3. Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
node tests/e2e/workflow-integration-test.js

# Run optimization
node scripts/optimize-production.js
```

### 4. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Health check endpoints configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] Usage analytics setup (if required)

# Undefined Elements and Clarifications Needed

This document lists the questions and clarifications needed to finalize the technical specification for the node-based query system.

## 1. Data Source Integration

*   What specific data sources do we need to support for the initial launch?
*   What are the authentication mechanisms for these data sources? (e.g., API keys, OAuth, database credentials)
*   Are there any performance considerations or rate limits we need to be aware of for these data sources?

## 2. Node-Specific UI

*   What are the specific UI requirements for each of the initial node types (DataSource, Filter, Sort, Aggregate)?
*   How should the UI handle complex configurations, such as nested conditions in a Filter node?

## 3. Formula Visualization

*   What is the complete syntax for the formula language?
*   How should the formula visualization handle errors or invalid connections?

## 4. Error Handling

*   How should the system handle errors that occur during query execution? (e.g., data source unavailable, invalid query logic)
*   What information should be displayed to the user when an error occurs?

## 5. Security and Permissions

*   What are the security requirements for the system?
*   How will user permissions be handled? (e.g., who can create, edit, and execute queries)
*   Are there any data privacy or compliance requirements we need to consider?

## 6. Integration with Existing Workflow System

*   What is the specific API or mechanism for integrating the query system with the existing workflow system?
*   What data needs to be passed between the query system and the workflow system?

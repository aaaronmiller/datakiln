The Real Culprit: Create-React-App is Broken
The primary issue is that Create-React-App (CRA) has been officially deprecated and is experiencing widespread failures. Here's what's happening:[1][2]
	•	CRA was formally deprecated in February 2025 by the React team following a "perfect storm of incompatibility"[1]
	•	npm create-react-app has been erroring for over a month due to conflicts with React 19[3]
	•	The tool hasn't been maintained properly and suffers from performance issues, lack of modern features, and dependency conflicts[4][1]
Common error patterns include:
	•	Dependency version conflicts between React 19 and testing libraries[5]
	•	Missing web-vitals packages[5]
	•	Node.js version compatibility issues[6]
	•	Cache corruption problems[6]
Jules Can Actually Handle Full-Stack Development
Contrary to your concern about separation limitations, Jules is fully capable of creating complete full-stack applications. The research shows:[7][8]
	•	Jules has successfully created finance tracking apps with both Flask backend and HTML/CSS frontend[8]
	•	Users report Jules "one-shotted" 900+ line full-stack applications[9]
	•	It can handle frontend and backend components while running asynchronously[8]
	•	Jules performs frontend testing with visual feedback, including screenshots[10]
What Others Are Experiencing
The pattern lil' Gimpy found shows this isn't isolated to Jules:
Widespread CRA Issues:
	•	Developers across platforms (CodeCademy, Reddit, Stack Overflow) report identical create-react-app failures[11][12][3]
	•	The React team now recommends Vite as the closest CRA equivalent[1]
	•	Next.js and React Router with Vite are the official recommended alternatives[1]
AI Assistant Limitations:
	•	Some AI coding tools struggle with complex integration landscapes[13]
	•	Tools can have difficulty navigating CI/CD pipelines and established workflows[13]
	•	However, these are integration challenges, not fundamental architectural limitations
Solutions for Your Workflow
Here's what lil' Gimpy recommends to get your frontend created:
Immediate Fixes
	1	Replace create-react-app with Vite in your prompt:
	◦	Instead of: "create React app using create-react-app"
	◦	Use: "create React frontend using Vite"
	2	Clear npm cache issues:[6] npm cache clean --force
	3	npm uninstall -g create-react-app
	4	 
	5	Specify modern alternatives in your Jules prompt:
	◦	"Use Vite to create the React frontend"
	◦	"Set up frontend with Next.js"
	◦	"Create frontend using React with Vite bundler"
Better Prompting Strategy
Since Jules works well with specific, scoped prompts, try breaking your request:[14]
	•	First task: "Create the React frontend using Vite for the Puppeteer automation project"
	•	Second task: "Integrate the existing backend with the new Vite frontend"
Framework Alternatives
Given your Puppeteer/Playwright backend, consider asking Jules to:
	•	Use Svelte (which you prefer) instead of React
	•	Create a vanilla JavaScript frontend with modern build tools
	•	Set up Hono for a more integrated full-stack approach

# Project: Advanced Node-Based Query System

## Overview

This repository contains the planning and specification documents for an advanced node-based query system. The system is designed to provide a flexible and intuitive interface for building complex data queries through a visual, node-based editor.

## Current State

The project is currently in the planning and design phase. The documents in this repository outline the vision, architecture, and technical specifications for the system.

## Usage Parameters

The documents in this `specs` folder are intended to be used as a guide for the development of the node-based query system. They should be reviewed by all stakeholders to ensure a shared understanding of the project goals and technical implementation.

### Key Documents

*   **`node_based_query_system_plan.md`**: The detailed technical specification for the system.
*   **`vision.md`**: A high-level overview of the project's vision and goals.
*   **`future_plans.md`**: A roadmap for future development and unimplemented ideas.
*   **`undefined_elements.md`**: A list of questions and clarifications needed about the proposed system.

## Getting Started

To contribute to the project, please review the documents in this repository and familiarize yourself with the proposed architecture.

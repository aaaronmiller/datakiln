# Frontend Architecture

This document outlines the frontend architecture for the AI Research Automation Platform, built with Next.js.

## 1. Directory Structure

The `frontend/src` directory will be organized as follows to ensure a clean and scalable codebase:

```
frontend/src/
├── app/                # Next.js App Router: pages, layouts, and route handlers
├── components/         # Reusable React components
│   ├── core/           # Custom, application-specific components (e.g., WorkflowBuilder)
│   └── ui/             # Components from shadcn/ui
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                # Utility functions, helpers, and constants
├── store/              # State management logic (e.g., Zustand stores)
├── styles/             # Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration
└── types/              # TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
```

## 2. Core Components

The following are the primary, reusable UI components that will form the core of the user interface.

*   **`Header`**: The main navigation bar at the top of the page. It will contain the application logo, navigation links, and user-related controls.
*   **`Sidebar`**: A persistent sidebar for navigating between the main sections of the application, such as the Dashboard, Workflows, and Settings.
*   **`WorkflowBuilder`**: The central component of the application. A drag-and-drop interface where users can visually construct and connect tasks to create a research workflow.
*   **`TaskNode`**: Represents a single, configurable task within the `WorkflowBuilder`. Each node will have inputs for parameters and outputs to connect to other nodes.
*   **`ControlPanel`**: A dedicated section of the UI containing controls to start, pause, stop, and schedule the execution of a defined workflow.
*   **`ResultsDisplay`**: A component responsible for rendering the data and results generated by a completed research workflow in a structured and readable format.

## 3. State Management

For managing application-wide state, we will use **Zustand**.

### Justification:

*   **Simplicity and Minimal Boilerplate:** Zustand offers a simple and intuitive API that is easy to learn and implement, avoiding the extensive boilerplate often associated with libraries like Redux.
*   **Lightweight:** It is a small library, which helps keep the application bundle size down.
*   **Performance:** It avoids the performance issues of React Context with high-frequency updates and prevents unnecessary re-renders.
*   **Flexibility:** It is unopinionated and can be easily integrated into a Next.js application without wrapping the entire app in a provider, making it ideal for both client and server components. This is particularly useful for managing the complex state of the `WorkflowBuilder` (e.g., node positions, connections, and individual task configurations).

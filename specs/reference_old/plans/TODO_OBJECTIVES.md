# TODO Objectives

## Summary of Completed Work

Based on the traceability matrix, the project has achieved 15% completion (6/39 requirements fully implemented) with 21% partial progress (8/39 requirements).

### Fully Implemented (6/39 - 15%)
- Dashboard route with Sidebar/Header rendering
- Selectors lab route with Sidebar/Header rendering
- Extension capture route with Sidebar/Header rendering
- Settings route with Sidebar/Header rendering
- domAction node type fully implemented
- transform node type fully implemented

### Partially Implemented (8/39 - 21%)
- Workflows route (ReactFlow issues blocking)
- Runs route (SSE streaming not implemented)
- Results route (artifact download not implemented)
- Templates route (template creation not implemented)
- Transcript analysis route (YouTube processing incomplete)
- Command palette route (no dedicated route)
- Node palette listing (rendering incomplete)
- UI validation (form validation missing)
- Results API endpoint (artifact handling incomplete)
- dataSource node (full implementation incomplete)
- domQuery node (domQuery specific logic missing)
- filter node (filter-specific logic incomplete)
- urlTemplate node (urlTemplate functionality missing)
- SSE smoke test (engine not implemented)

This provides a solid foundation with routing infrastructure and basic node types, but critical workflow execution and UI stability gaps remain.

## Orchestrated Worklist

| Objective | Owner | Estimate | Dependencies | PR Acceptance Tests |
|-----------|-------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Fix ReactFlow performance issues | Frontend Team | 3 days | None | Workflow canvas renders 50+ nodes without performance degradation (<100ms response time), no memory leaks, proper error boundaries |
| Implement basic node execution engine | Backend Team | 5 days | ReactFlow fixes | Engine emits nodeStarted/nodeFinished on 3-node demo under 10s, handles node execution failures gracefully |
| Implement API endpoints for workflow execution | Backend Team | 4 days | Basic node execution engine | POST /api/workflows/execute returns runId, GET /api/runs/:id/stream emits SSE events |
| Implement form generation from schema | Frontend Team | 3 days | ReactFlow fixes | Node editors auto-generate forms from paramsSchema, forms validate required params |
| Implement import/export validation | Frontend Team | 2 days | Form generation | Import/Export validates against WORKFLOW_SCHEMA_V1.json, export → import returns identical graph |
| Implement SSE streaming for runs | Backend Team | 3 days | API endpoints | GET /api/runs/:id/stream provides SSE events for real-time monitoring |
| Implement template creation workflow | Frontend Team | 4 days | Import/export validation | Create templates from existing graphs, template creation identifies and parameterizes node-specific values |
| Implement artifact storage and download | Backend Team | 3 days | API endpoints | GET /api/results/:id provides artifact index with download URLs |
| Implement schema validation | Backend Team | 2 days | None | Workflow JSON validates against schema, POST /execute validates workflow and returns runId |
| Implement error handling and reliability features | Full Stack Team | 5 days | Node execution engine | Failed node execution stops workflow and emits error event, provider timeout/failure gracefully degrades with retry logic |

## Roadmap for Remaining Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation Fixes (Weeks 1-4)
**Immediate Priority (Next 2 weeks):**
- ReactFlow performance fixes (critical blocker)
- Implement missing scripts (YouTube transcription, automation)
- Stabilize QueryNode and QueryEditor components

**Short-term (Weeks 3-4):**
- Basic node execution engine
- Complete basic node types (DataSource, Filter, Transform)
- Query graph persistence and JSON serialization

### Phase 2: Query System Core (Weeks 5-8)
**Advanced Node Types (Weeks 5-6):**
- Aggregate, Join, Union node implementations
- Custom node creation framework
- Node parameter validation and error handling

**Workflow Integration (Weeks 7-8):**
- QueryNode integration with WorkflowBuilder
- Workflow-as-query execution patterns
- Query result visualization and export

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)
**Enhanced Functionality (Weeks 9-10):**
- Real-time collaboration features
- Query versioning and history
- Advanced data source connectors
- Performance optimization for large graphs

**Integration Completion (Weeks 11-12):**
- Chrome extension integration with query system
- Context portal utilization for query storage
- Advanced automation workflows
- Production deployment preparation

### Open Questions to Address
- Node versioning handling for execution mismatches
- Workflow state persistence across sessions
- Real-time collaboration conflict resolution
- Performance scaling for 100+ node workflows
- Data source reliability and timeout handling
- Template parameterization
- Extension data flow integration
- Transcript processing for multiple formats
- Selector lab DOM validation
- Collaboration conflict resolution

**Total Estimated Timeline:** 12 weeks
**Critical Path:** ReactFlow fixes → Node execution engine → API endpoints → UI integration

# Traceability Matrix Update Procedures

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive procedures for maintaining the TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md with quality controls, audit trails, and systematic review cycles. It transforms manual matrix maintenance from an ad-hoc process to a documented, reliable system.

## Progress Tracking Procedures

### Update Triggers

Matrix updates must occur when any of the following conditions are met:

- **Code Changes**: New implementations, modifications, or deletions affecting traced components
- **Specification Updates**: Changes to requirements, contracts, or design documents
- **Status Changes**: Implementation status transitions (missing → partial → implemented)
- **Weekly Reviews**: Mandatory weekly progress assessment (see Review Cycles)
- **Milestone Completions**: End of sprint, release, or significant feature delivery

### Completion Percentage Assessment Guidelines

#### Implemented (100%)
- All acceptance criteria fully satisfied
- Code implemented and tested
- Documentation updated
- Integration verified
- No known issues or TODOs

#### Partial (40-80%)
- Core functionality exists but incomplete
- Basic acceptance criteria met
- May have known limitations or TODOs
- Requires additional work to reach full implementation

#### Missing (0%)
- No implementation exists
- Acceptance criteria not met
- May have placeholder code or design only

### Update Process Steps

1. **Identify Changes**: Review recent commits, PRs, and issue updates
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine which matrix entries are affected
3. **Gather Evidence**: Collect code references, test results, and documentation
4. **Update Entries**: Modify matrix with new completion percentages and notes
5. **Validate Changes**: Run validation checklist (see Validation Checklists)
6. **Document Rationale**: Record change reasons in audit trail
7. **Peer Review**: Submit for review if completion >50% or status change

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Pre-Update Validation Requirements

#### Code-to-Documentation Verification
- [ ] Implementation matches specification requirements
- [ ] All referenced files exist and are accessible
- [ ] Module/route/test paths are accurate
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are clearly defined and testable

#### Accuracy Checks
- [ ] Completion percentages reflect actual implementation state
- [ ] Status values (implemented/partial/missing) are correct
- [ ] Owner assignments are current and accurate
- [ ] Notes provide meaningful context for current state

#### Consistency Validation
- [ ] Progress calculation methodology applied consistently
- [ ] Status transitions follow logical progression
- [ ] Cross-references between related entries are maintained

### Quality Gates

#### Gate 1: Individual Entry Review
- Required for all updates
- Self-review using validation checklist
- Automated consistency checks where possible

#### Gate 2: Peer Review
- Required for completion changes >20% or status transitions
- Reviewer validates evidence and rationale
- Escalation to technical lead for disputed changes

#### Gate 3: Weekly Quality Audit
- Comprehensive review of all changes since last audit
- Statistical analysis of progress trends
- Identification of quality issues or inconsistencies
